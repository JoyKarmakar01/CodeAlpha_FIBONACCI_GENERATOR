**Name: Joy Karmakar**
**Internsip Organization: CodeAlpha.**
**Task** - Fibonacci Generator.**

**Objective**- The primary objective of this project is to develop a Jupyter Notebook-based tool that allows users to input the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence and then displays the corresponding sequence. This interactive program will serve as a practical example of how to implement a basic algorithm in Python and present the results in a visually engaging format.
What is Fibonacci Sequence:
The Fibonacci sequence is a fascinating mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. It has wide-ranging applications in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and even nature. In this project, we will create a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence and present it within the user-friendly


**Conclusion:**

**Our project created a fun program in Jupyter Notebook to show Fibonacci numbers. It's a cool math trick.**
